Data visualization with Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a powerful tool in producing visually striking plots. Yet compare with other visualization tools, such as ppplot, seaborn, bokeh, etc, the use of Matplotlib in advanced plotting is much less. One of the main reason is that Matplotlib has a much steeper learn curving. Through my learning, i found that understanding its Object-oriented interface are crucial. 


In this notebook, I use examples to illustrate the Object-oriented interface and how you can effectively use Matplotlib to customize a plot in any way you like. Working through these example helped me build a deeper understanding of this interface.
